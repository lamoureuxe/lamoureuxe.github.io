I am a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver. My research uses computer vision and deep learning to evaluate the properties of single cells. This work bridges the mechatronics and biomedical engineering research groups at UBC. After graduation, I will pursue a machine learning role in industry or academia. 

My PhD thesis includes two large deep learning projects: (1) evaluating red blood cells to identify long-lasting transfusions and (2) real-time assessment of rare sperm cells for in vitro fertilization. 

During my PhD, I have developed skills beyond the traditional scope of mechanical engineering. These include computer science (e.g., machine learning, deep learning, computer vision), computer engineering (e.g., firmware, real-time operating systems), electrical engineering (e.g., instrumentation, mechatronics, microdevices), and applications to biomedical systems. 

My teaching experience includes three upper-year mechatronics courses covering (1) electrical instrumentation, (2) mechatronic system instrumentation, and (3) mechatronics product design. Specifically, I teach the labs including (1) instrumentation for temperature, strain gauge, and optical sensors, (2) C# user interface design, microcontroller C firmware programming, and motor control, and (3) printed circuit board design and product development.
